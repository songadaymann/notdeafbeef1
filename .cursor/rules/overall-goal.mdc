The overall goal here is to create an onchain NFT project in the style of Deafbeef. He's my friend. I want to subtly poke fun at him with this project. He always makes a huge deal out of the fact that his onchain works use "nothing but a c compiler".

I want to try to do him one better, and make MY onchain project in assembly. 

First we'll work on the generative music part
Then we'll do the generative visuals
Then finally we'll work on the blockchain stuff
